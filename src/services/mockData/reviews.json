    "text": "The titanium design feels incredibly premium and lightweight. Camera quality is outstanding, especially in low light conditions. The A17 Pro chip makes everything buttery smooth. Battery life easily lasts me a full day with heavy use. Totally worth the upgrade from my iPhone 13 Pro.",

    "text": "Upgraded from iPhone 14 Pro and honestly don't feel a massive difference in daily use. The titanium is nice but the weight reduction is minimal. Camera is slightly better but not revolutionary. If you have a 14 Pro, might want to skip this generation unless you really want the latest tech.",
